### How are measurement groups created?

The plugin searches for the nearest parent group/frame and places it there.

### May I rename/move the measurement groups?

There are two different measurement groups attached groups (📐 Measurements) and detached groups (🔌 Measurements).

With detached groups you can do anything you want.
With attached groups I would not recommend it, because "Figma-Measure" searches for it and needs it to control the measurements.

If "Figma-Measure" does not find one of these groups, it creates new ones.
